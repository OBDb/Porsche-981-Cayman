    description: "The Porsche 981 Cayman represented the second generation of Porsche's mid-engine coupe, introduced in 2013 following the redesign of its convertible sibling, the Boxster. Built on a new platform featuring increased use of aluminum, the 981 Cayman was approximately 66 pounds lighter than its predecessor while offering 40% greater torsional rigidity. The wheelbase was extended by 2.4 inches, creating a more stable platform and increasing interior space. The standard Cayman featured a 2.7-liter flat-six producing 275 horsepower, while the Cayman S employed a 3.4-liter flat-six with 325 horsepower. The top-tier Cayman GTS, introduced in 2014, produced 340 horsepower from its 3.4-liter engine. The ultimate expression of the 981 Cayman was the GT4, featuring a 3.8-liter engine derived from the 911 Carrera S producing 385 horsepower, aggressive aerodynamics, and track-focused suspension tuning. All variants were available with either a 6-speed manual or 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. The redesigned exterior featured more sculptural styling with larger side air intakes, a steeper windshield angle, and a distinctive spoiler edge integrated into the taillights. The interior quality was significantly upgraded with a design inspired by the Panamera, featuring a sloping center console and improved materials. The 981 Cayman was praised for its near-perfect balance, communicative steering, and exceptional handling dynamics, cementing its reputation as one of the purest sports car experiences available before the transition to turbocharged four-cylinder engines in the succeeding 718 generation."
